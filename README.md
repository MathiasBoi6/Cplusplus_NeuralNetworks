# Neural Networks in C++

This repo is currently unfinished.

Missing:
* Allow custom number of neural network layers
* Use matrix multiplication than the current imperative implementation
* A reference to what files are being used in the 'test'

## MNIST number recogniztion

This project contains:
* A library for neural networks
* A test program for recognizing the MNIST number dataset, with a GUI.

## Why???

I wanted to learn C++ and Neural networks :).
